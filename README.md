ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, I'm @hicker-coderâ€” a Data Scientist and Python Dev with a strong background in RPA and web scraping. My game? Uncovering hidden gems in data through mining, detailed analysis, and powerful statistical modeling, all while mastering the art of machine learning.

Right now, I'm diving deep into the world of open-source Large Language Models (LLMs).

I'm on the lookout for exciting projects and keen to team up with other data enthusiasts. Find me on LinkedIn or shoot me an email, and let's explore the possibilities of open-source LLMs together!
