👋 Hi, I'm @hicker-coder, a highly motivated and detail-oriented data scientist with a passion for exploring the vast potential of data-driven solutions. 
    I have extensive experience in Robotic Process Automation (RPA) and web scraping .

👀 I am interested in discovering patterns and insights hidden in data that can help organizations make informed decisions. 
   My expertise lies in data mining, data analysis, statistical modeling, and machine learning. 
   I am constantly exploring new techniques and tools to improve my skills and stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends.

🌱 I am currently learning advanced techniques in machine learning and deep learning,  
   which I believe can add value to the projects I work on. 
   I am also exploring data visualization techniques that can effectively communicate complex data insights to a wide range of stakeholders.

💞️ I am looking to collaborate with like-minded professionals on projects that challenge me and enable me to apply my skills to solve real-world problems. I believe in collaboration, and I am always open to learning from others and sharing my knowledge.
